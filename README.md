## Notes

This is my 2nd challenge in Frontend Mentor, and definitely a step-up in difficulty, having been in a roadblock on the first half dealing with CSS and positioning.

With this challenge, included new requirements, such as:

- *More* optimized readability of code
- Improved CSS handling with positioning
- Flexible sizing of panels
- Use of Javascript for the accordion effect
- Changing states of elements and CSS properties

Overall, the process was as enjoyable as it was difficult, while there were many new unfamiliar features, I learned a lot and am excited to take on new challenges.
